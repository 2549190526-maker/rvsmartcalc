![Interest Rate Trend 2026](/blog/rv-loan-spike.jpg)

Google Trends doesn’t lie—people are panicked about RV interest rates.

Searches for “RV loan rates” and “HELOC” are up roughly **140%**.

That’s not curiosity..

That’s fear.

People see higher monthly payments, confused dealer quotes, and they’re scrambling for anything that looks like a workaround.

Big banks are happy to “help”.

So are dealerships.

They’re not the ones who end up broke and stuck.

You are.

## 1. The 140% Spike: What the Data Really Says

When search volume jumps this hard, it means one thing: buyers don’t trust what they’re being told.

They’re seeing:

- “Special low RV rates!” in dealer ads.  
- Very different numbers from their bank.  
- HELOC offers popping up in their online banking app.  

The 140% spike in “RV loan rates” tells you buyers feel blindsided.

The matching spike in “HELOC” tells you they’re hunting for a back door.

That’s exactly when people make dumb, rushed decisions.

They stop asking “Is this smart?” and start asking “Can I make the payment?”

That’s how you end up pledging your house against a depreciating toy.

## 2. The HELOC Temptation: Why It Can Be a Debt Trap in 2026

On paper, a HELOC looks clever.

Your bank whispers:

“Why take a 10% RV loan when you can use your home equity at 7–8%?”

Lower rate.

Interest may be tax-favored.

Flexible draws.

Sounds clean.

Here’s the part they don’t emphasize.

You’re converting **secured housing equity** into a **churning liability tied to a depreciating RV**.

In 2026, most HELOCs:

- Are **variable rate**, tied to prime or similar benchmarks.  
- Have already climbed a long way from the cheap money era.  
- Can move even higher if macro rates tick back up.  

That “7.5% for now” line of credit can turn into 9–10% over a few years.

Meanwhile, your RV is dropping 15–20% the moment you register it, then another 10–15% over the next couple of years.

If you need to unload the rig, the math looks like this:

- RV value tanks.  
- HELOC balance barely shrinks, because you only paid interest or made small principal payments.  
- You still owe the bank, and the collateral they care about is your **house**, not your camper.

You can sell an RV.

You can’t sell just the part of your house you pledged.

In a rising or choppy-rate environment, using a HELOC to buy a rapidly depreciating asset is leverage stacked on top of leverage.

One market shock, job loss, or health hit and you’re fighting to keep a roof over your head because of a bad weekend rig decision.

That’s not “creative financing”.

That’s playing chicken with your home.

## 3. Credit Unions (USAA/Navy Federal) vs. Dealer Financing

Now for the good news: you don’t have to choose between ugly RV loan offers and risking your house with a HELOC.

There’s a middle ground.

Credit unions and member-focused institutions—**USAA**, **Navy Federal Credit Union**, and others—have quietly become the place where a lot of the **real** RV loan deals are hiding.

Here’s how they often compare.

Dealer financing:

- You get a rate the **lender** approves.  
- Then the dealer **marks it up** 1–3% to pad their profit.  
- You’re distracted by monthly payment talk, not APR or total interest.  

Credit unions / member banks:

- Usually no rate markup games.  
- Transparent APR tiers based on your credit score.  
- Often better terms for active duty, veterans, or long-time members.  

If USAA or Navy Federal offers you 8.25% and the dealer waves a magic wand and “gets you approved” at 9.99%, that’s not a favor.

That’s a spread.

On an **$80,000 loan over 15 years**, the difference between:

- 8.25% ≈ **$781/month**  
- 9.99% ≈ **$857/month**  

That’s about **$76/month**, or over **$13,000** in extra interest over the life of the loan.

All for clicking a different dropdown in their software.

This is why you **never** walk onto a lot without outside quotes.

Get pre-approval from USAA, Navy Federal, or your local credit union.

Walk in with real numbers in your pocket.

Then see if the dealer can **beat** them.

If not, you already know where your loan is coming from.

## 4. The “Stupidity Tax”: Missing 1% = A Year of Fuel

You don’t feel a 1% APR difference in your hand.

You feel it in your life.

Let’s talk in terms of fuel and campgrounds, not abstract math.

Say you finance **$90,000** over **15 years (180 months)**.

At 8.5% APR:

- Payment ≈ **$885**  
- Total interest ≈ **$69,300**

At 9.5% APR:

- Payment ≈ **$937**  
- Total interest ≈ **$78,660**

That 1% difference costs you about **$53/month**.

Over the full term, that’s roughly **$9,360** in extra interest.

Call it ten grand.

At 10 mpg, $3.75/gallon fuel, $40/night average camping, that ten grand buys roughly:

- **6,000+ miles** of fuel, **and**  
- **150+ nights** in decent campgrounds.

So when you shrug at an extra 1% and say, “Not a big deal,” what you’re really saying is:

“I’d rather hand the bank a full year of road time than spend 20 minutes running the numbers.”

That’s the **stupidity tax**.

You pay it by guessing instead of calculating.

Or by trusting a dealer’s “estimate” instead of verifying with real math.

Don’t guess your monthly payment based on a dealer's “estimate.” Use the tool the pros use to see the actual interest cost over the life of your loan: https://rvsmartcalc.com/calculators/loan

That’s how you stop donating fuel and campfire nights to the finance office.

## 5. Final Verdict: Run the Numbers Before You Sign

Here’s the blunt summary.

- RV loan rates are up. Everyone feels it.  
- HELOC searches are spiking because people are desperate.  
- Using home equity to chase a “lower rate” on a depreciating RV is a great way to turn a toy into a housing risk.  
- Dealer financing is built to maximize **their** profit, not minimize your interest.  

Your defense is simple.

You run the math **before** you sit down in the chair.

You get quotes from USAA, Navy Federal, and other credit unions.

You plug every option into the [RV Loan Calculator](https://rvsmartcalc.com/calculators/loan) and stare at the **total interest**, not just the payment.

You decide what’s acceptable.

Then you walk in and treat any offer that doesn’t beat your baseline as noise.

Dealers and banks make money off confusion and urgency.

You kill both by coming in armed with hard numbers.

Run the numbers.

Slow the process down.

If the deal still looks good after that, sign it.

If not, walk away with your equity, your house, and your future road trips intact.
